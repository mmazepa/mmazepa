### Hello there

:book: I know a lot of things but I never forget that I still have a lot to learn.

:mortar_board: During my undergraduate studies my specialization was "**Web Applications and Databases**".

:mortar_board: I finished master's degree in computer science. My master's thesis was about **graph coloring** and its applications in solving puzzles like Sudoku, N-Queens problem etc.

:spaghetti: I love cooking, baking and everything like that. I have always thought that **algorithms are like recipes**.
